# Novice password/hash cracker

Created my own password and hash cracker. Used the hashing algorithms from the project that I was assigned and was supposed to crack. Part1 will look for hash from a given pool of hash and a fixed salt, but you can definitely change this to random salt + random hash and it will still work as expected. Part 2 is a simple dictionary brute force on one of the most famous .txt file in cyberworld "rockyou.txt". If these codes run that means the website is flawed and hence I have certain measures to mitigate such simple attacks.
